I was reading O'Rourke's [history of meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2121629/) paper and he mentions what is possibly the [first paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2282137.pdf?casa_token=2po0hqgzeAsAAAAA:Owjpbq5b_YSF9NqwfSxp66-C6n9NKUBDDRdlQ-82qW02It6ijJOI-gMW_6CyQnNNnQpdVJmd3Bzn9eBRyZ4mWWvbFmZAn_6WEEfS8l9TjvX787wsNAM) to systematically look at publication bias based on significance. This is Sterling's 1959 paper "Publication Decisions and Their Possible Effects on Inferences Drawn from Tests of Significance--Or Vice Versa".

This table struck me:

![Table 32 from Sterling (1959). It has 4 columns. First column is a list of journals with "total at the bottom". Second is percent of artciles that test a hypothesis. Third is percent that reject H0. Fourth is percent that do not. All journals have ober 95% of artciles rejecting H0. Total is 97.28% of artciles that test reject H0](/home/assets/blogassets/tablepubbias.PNG)

Higney, A., Hanley, N., Moro, M., 2021. <a href="/home/assets/images/LeadCrimeMetaAnalysis_20220110.pdf">The Lead-Crime Hypothesis: A Meta-Analysis</a>

Does lead pollution increase crime? We perform the first meta-analysis of the effect of lead on crime by pooling 542 estimates from 24 studies. We analyse the full sample, converted to partial correlations, and a subsample for which elasticities are available. In both samples we find evidence of publication bias across a range of tests. This publication bias means that the effect of lead is overstated in the literature. We perform over 1 million meta-regression specifications, controlling for this bias, and conditioning on observable between-study heterogeneity. The estimated mean effect size is a partial correlation of 0.16 in the full sample, and an elasticity of 0.11 in the subsample. When we restrict our analysis to only high-quality studies that address endogeneity the estimated mean partial correlation is close to zero. An elasticity of 0.11 suggests the fall in lead over recent decades may be responsible for a 10% fall in homicide in the US. Our results imply that although lead pollution does have a positive effect on crime, it does not explain the majority of the fall in crime observed in many countries in the 20th century, and additional explanations are needed.

The Impact of Lead Pollution on Education: a Natural Experiment in Glasgow.

How does lead pollution affect educational outcomes? I analyse a natural experiment in Glasgow in 1989, where the cityâ€™s water supply was treated, which decreased the lead content in the water. I use a difference-in-discontinuity design, due to a confounding discontinuity at the point of treatment.

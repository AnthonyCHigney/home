Does lead pollution increase crime? We perform the first meta-analysis of the effect of lead on crime by pooling 542 estimates from 24 studies. We analyse the full sample, converted to partial correlations, and a subsample for which elasticities are available. In both samples we find evidence of publication bias across a range of tests. This publication bias means that the effect of lead is overstated in the literature. We perform over 1 million meta-regression specifications, controlling for this bias, and conditioning on observable between-study heterogeneity. The estimated mean effect size is a partial correlation of 0.16 in the full sample, and an elasticity of 0.11 in the subsample. When we restrict our analysis to only studies that address endogeneity with quasi-experimental research designs, the estimated mean partial correlation 0.01. An elasticity of 0.11 suggests the fall in lead over recent decades may be responsible for a 10% fall in homicide in the US. Our results imply that although lead pollution has a positive effect on crime, it does not explain the majority of the fall in crime observed in many countries in the 20th century, and additional explanations are needed.

Does lead pollution harm educational achievement? And are the marginal effects greater at low or high levels of lead? We use exogenous variation in lead pollution from water treatment in Glasgow, Scotland, combined with within-household sibling differences, to estimate the effect of lead on education. We compare pre and post-treatment sibling differences between treated and control areas with difference-in-differences estimation. We find a clear dose-response relationship. Treated areas with low prevalence of lead piping show no change compared to a control group. In contrast, high lead pipe prevalence areas show improvement in educational outcomes. Our findings indicate that countries and areas with very high levels of lead can expect large educational gains from even small amounts of lead abatement, while those with already low levels of lead can expect much lower marginal improvements.
